Intro: central nervous system, meridians, vagus nerve, burn-out reducer


Sequence 1: creating calm in the body
Sequence 2: the breath
Sequence 3: the hum



SEQUENCE 1 - Creating calm in the body



Lie down. Stretch out your arms above your head. Stretch further out. Squeeze the body until you feel tension all over. Hold, hold, and now release. Let out a sigh. Lay your arms by your side and let every muscle relax. Isolate one part of the body. Reach, create tension, hold, and then relax. Do you this with every part of your body until you feel all tension melt away.



SEQUENCE 2 - The breath



Sit up. Breath in from your belly watch it expand like a balloon. Now breath out and watch it contract in. Breath in from the belly, watch it expand, breath in more and pull the air up into the chest. Breath out, first from the chest, let your shoulders relax, then watch your belly contract. Breath in from the belly then breath in more to the chest, and then breath in more expand the chest. Breath out and watch the chest contract, then the belly contracts. Rest. Relax.

Do it in a sequence: breath in five, four, three, two, one, breath out five, four, three, two, one.



SEQUENCE 3 - The hum



When you hum you activate the vagus nerve, which connects to every major organ in your body. Think of yourself like a musical instrument. At your base hum a deep low bass note. Move up your torso and hum a tenor sound, then get progressively higher-pitched as you move up your body. Hum along with your favorite songs. You'll be do-re-me'ing yourself into perfect health in no time!



Wow, body connection is a great foundation. Congrats on finishing the second lesson!
