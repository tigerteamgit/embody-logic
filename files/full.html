<p>
Embodied Logic is not information to consume — it is a system to inhabit.
This work integrates body-based regulation, perception, and cognition into
a practical framework for clarity, creativity, and resilience.
</p>

<blockquote>
This is not about thinking harder.  
It’s about organizing your nervous system so thinking works.
</blockquote>

<h2>Why Embodied Logic</h2>
<p>
Most approaches to intelligence focus on abstraction alone. Embodied Logic
starts earlier — at sensation, posture, breath, and rhythm — because cognition
emerges from state.
</p>

<p>
When the body is dysregulated, thought fragments. When the body is organized,
logic becomes fluid.
</p>

<h2>The Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>State precedes strategy</li>
  <li>Regulation enables reasoning</li>
  <li>Movement organizes meaning</li>
  <li>Clarity is trained, not forced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice Over Theory</h2>
<p>
This is not a course you watch. Each section includes prompts, physical cues,
and perceptual shifts designed to be practiced in real time.
</p>

<p>
You will move between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somatic awareness</li>
  <li>Attention placement</li>
  <li>Conceptual framing</li>
  <li>Applied decision-making</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changes</h2>
<p>
Over time, practitioners report:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduced cognitive friction</li>
  <li>Improved creative throughput</li>
  <li>Greater emotional stability under pressure</li>
  <li>More reliable access to insight</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
<p>
Read slowly. Pause often. Let the body lead.  
If you feel the urge to rush — that’s the moment to stop.
</p>

Integration happens between the lines.
