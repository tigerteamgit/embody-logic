Intro: An athlete's game; doing the same practice, yields the same results







Sequence 1: Get out of routine



Sequence 2: Find your edge



Sequence 3: Challenge your fear



SEQUENCE 1 - Get out of routine



Inertia i- definition

Do you always take the route home? Find another way. This is not about saving time. This is about re-wiring your circuitry.



SEQUENCE 2 - Find your edge



Alot of yoga teachers press into this idea during a stretch. And I described it earlier in Module 1: it's that tension with a dull ache that feels good and painful at the same time. Let's take this concept off the mat and into every part of your life. Find your edge in life. What thrills you? Go deeper into it. Is there tension? Move your body around the tension; create more tension until the rope is taut. Now start to work out the knots. What is the easiest knot to undo first? Start to undo it. Now that you've released that knot, the rope is loosier. The next knot is easier to undo now. Keep working your way through each knot. Loosen up the rope, feed the rope ends through. Now release.



SEQUENCE 3 - Challenge your fear



What are your greatest fears? Is it heights? Or being confined? Do you fear social engagements? Or being alone? Is it spiders, bees, or anything wriggling out of your control? Whatever your fear, it's time to build some courage and face it. Put structure around it to give yourself more space to be around it.

If you're afraid of heights you need to climb something. If you're afraid of confinement then spend sometime in a sauna bed. If you fear meeting new people or talking to strangers then join a gathering where you are encouraged to meet new people; where everyone is meeting for the first time. If you're afraid of spiders, bees, or bugs then spend some time in the garden or on the lawn. Encounter their presence and realize you can co-exist and come to appreciate each other.
