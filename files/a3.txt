Intro: Movement is the flow of life; think childlike, dance, sports, and training in momentum







Sequence 1: body awarenes and freestyle dance



Sequence 2: mini parkour



Sequence 3: ambi challenge



SEQUENCE 1 - Body Awareness



Let's connect. Stand, crouch, sit, or lie down. Stretch outward. Where do you feel tension? Become more aware of that pain. Is it in the back? Lean a little forward, does that release it? Lean a little backward, does it feel more or less painful? Twist to each side, how does it feel now? If pain is sharp, release and go no further. If pain is dull, then lean in until it hurts so good.

Explore your levels. If you're standing then crouch down. If you're sitting then stand up. If your lying down then put your feet up. Change your posture vertically, horizontally, and situate your body into different movements. Where is the tension now? How can you move the rest of your body around the tension? What feels good for you to do?

Do you want to create a sequence; hold five, four, three, two, one. Relax. Repeat.

Do you want more movement; involve another part of your body that bends that tension. This is your edge.



Freestyle Dance



Increase the speed of movement. How do you want to move right now? Do you want to move your arm? Your leg? Do you want to twist it, punch it, kick it, stop drop and lock it? What do you want to do with your hips? Do they want to dip, flip, or sway to and fro? What about your knees? Do you want to wipe them like a squeegee? What about your feet? Do they want to tap to a beat? Do you want to shake it all over?

Find a song. Is it somber or a club thomper? What does your body want to do the minute the song plays? Give in to that want, repeat in beat, it's just what your body needs.



SEQUENCE 2 - Mini Parkour



Have you seen parkour? It's a freestyle movement through obstacles you find along your path. While it can be an extreme sport where pros jump off buildings, do backflips, and go splelunking. I want to take it back a notch and say we start off with some minor movements to let the free spirit in you flow.

Are you walking on a sidewalk? Tiptoe on the edge of the pavement. Do you see a park bench, then jump up on it. Do you see a tree or a light post? Grab onto it and swing. See a hedge, jump into it (reminds you of your college days)

Every obstacle in your path becomes something you interact with to get to your destination. Guaranteed your inner child will be at play.



SEQUENCE 3 - Ambi-Challenge



Are you right-handed? Left-handed? Whichever side is dominant, it's time to train to be ambidextrous. Start drinking and eating with the less-dominant hand. Choose a day where you always stick to the switch-up.

Are you regular-footed or goofy-footed? This is a snowboarding test. Stand straight with your feet touching and then fall forward. Which foot steps out first? That is your dominant foot. If it's the right you're regular and left then you're goofy. It doesn't matter if you're right or left-handed. Stand on the leg. Move your other leg forward, then backward, then one side, then the other. Keep your balance, strengthen your muscle to hold it longer.

Do you know your natural sight pattern? Point at something. Now close one eye. Are you still pointing at your target? Open that eye and close the other eye. Are you closer or further off? Whichever eye is pointing at the target is your dominant eye. Close that eye and open your other one. Move your hand over the target. Relax. Repeat. Let's take it to target practice. Darts, arrows, pool, whatever your game. Look at your target. Breath in naturally. As you're breathing out, through your exhale; before all the air is out, release the projectile. This helps you overcome the sine wave motion you make when you breath. Practice this and you'll be hitting bullseyes in no-time!



Congrats! You've finished the first lesson!
